# Molecular-Dynamics-for-Leanord-Jones-Potential

## Project Overview  
This project simulates particle dynamics using forces and periodic boundary conditions. The simulation is based on the **Lennard-Jones potential** and verifies key physical properties, including:  

- **Conservation of Energy**  
- **Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution**  
- **Particle interaction visualization**  

## Features  
âœ… Implements **Lennard-Jones potential** for inter-particle interactions  
âœ… Uses **periodic boundary conditions** to simulate an infinite system  
âœ… Verifies **Conservation of Energy** during simulation  
âœ… Computes and demonstrates the **Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution**  
âœ… Provides a **visualization of particle interactions**  

## Implementation  
- The main simulation script is **[`PROJECT.m`](PROJECT.m)**, which sets up and runs the particle dynamics simulation.  
- The final simulation result is stored in **[`finish.mp4`](finish.mp4)**, showing the evolution of the system.  

## How to Run  
1. Run the script **`PROJECT.m`** in **MATLAB** to execute the simulation.  
2. View the final simulation result in **`finish.mp4`**.  

## Repository Information  
This project was developed as part of a **semester project** during a master's degree. It is fully wrapped up and not planned for further development.
